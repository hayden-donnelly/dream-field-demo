# dream-field-demo
Dream Field is a place where humans and AI can interact in previously impossible ways. In this place, they can learn from each other, and together, strive to create a better world. This is a demo of the Dream Field concept.

## Core Objectives
### 1. Education
AI and virtual reality will revolutionize education as we know it. Dream Field sits at the intersection of these technologies and aims to make education faster, more immersive, and more accessible than ever before. Students will no longer read about far away places and abstract concepts, they will experience them. On a wim they will be able to travel to the bottom of the ocean, or to the surface of Mars. They will be able to see the world through the eyes of famous historical figures, and witness firsthand the decisions that have shaped the world we live in. All of this, made possible by generative AI, and enhanced by virtual reality.

### 2. Communication
Large language models are impressive, but they are stuck inside a chat box that limits our ability to communicate with them. To get the most out of AI, we must open channels for non-verbal communication. Dream Field enables this by creating virtual worlds where both humans and AI are embodied. When you look at something in Dream Field, the AI will know what you're looking at. When you move your hands to exagerate a point, the AI will understand. This is the future of human-AI communication.

### 3. Production
Education and communication set the stage for our most important objective: production. By providing these pillars, Dream Field aims to accelerate technological innovation and scientific discovery. By working inside Dream Field, we will be able to understand problems in a whole new light and iterate on solutions faster than ever before.
